Welcome to my Memory Game App! In this game, there are multiple characters from the famous TV show "PAW PATROL". Your job is to click on different "cards" (Touchable Opacities) and
obtain a matching pair. If the pair is matching, then the two cards will remain "unflipped" to display that. If they are not matching, however, then the cards will become 
unflipped once again. The goal is to match every single pair of cards, which is shuffled each time you start a new game, so no cheating! On the top, the number of attempts you have 
used will be displayed. At the end, this number is displayed again in an alert congratulating you on your victory. As for how I made this app function, it is as follows. I set the 
user's first flip to its own variable, and the same for its second flip. If the url's are the same, then the pair is matching, and the opposite if they are not the same. One neat
trick is that all other buttons will be disabled while the app checks if the pair is a match. On the bottom, there is a reset button, which reshuffles the array for the user to 
play again. My code does have its limitations, however. For example, it takes some time for all of the images to render, so pressing a button too early can lead to some complications
with what the user actually pressed. Moreover, some of the images are not transparent, so they have borders. This was simply an issue with the links I chose, and was not easy to fix
on its own. Besides these drawbacks, the app is still very enjoyable, and I hope you have fun playing with it!
